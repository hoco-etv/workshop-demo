        <h3>Use of pages</h3>
        <p>The most common way to use pages is with a link in the menu. That way the page can be easily found in your website</p>
        <p>However, if you want a special page, maybe you don't want the page to be visible in the menu. Than you create a page, do not link it to the menu and make an URL pointing to that page. That way you have a nice URL to distribute pointing to that page.</p>

        <h3>Editing pages</h3>
        <p>When editing pages, you have two modi to do so. First you can edit the page properties, like the title and the access rights. Second, you can edit the page content. This is in a different view, so you can immediatly see the way the page will look in your website.</p>
        <p><span class='label label-default'>Beware</span> Editing and viewing the page can look a bit different from the actual view of the page when it's viewed via a menu item.</p>
