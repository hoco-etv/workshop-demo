<h3>Inventory management</h3>
This module shows the current inventory of the klushok and its associated price. Any products in this list are visible in the pricelist at the user side of the site. After adding a component you can change its price and its stock status (available, unknown, limited, sold-out). The stock will change from 'available' to 'limited' when a user reports he/she couldn't find an item via the site.
